# /cmd

This directory holds the main executable applications of your project. Each subdirectory within `/cmd` represents a distinct executable. For instance, `/cmd/api` might contain the `main.go` file for your API server, while `/cmd/worker` could house the entry point for a background worker. This separation allows for building and deploying different components independently.
